      <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Tabitha Mclaughlin. Do you need a creative, motivated, energetic developer to
        bring your ideas to life? Well you came to the right place.</p>
      <p>
        In 2019 I graduated from UCF for full stack web development. Since then i've taught and trained new upcoming
        developers the ropes to following their career dreams. I also freelance and create special content for clients
        just like you!
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no limits to my work and I am always motivated to learn new things. Being a fast learner definitely
        helps me when it comes to this job. I have excellent communication skills and will work with my clients to make
        the best design and feel for their website. I will go above and beyond until my client is 100% happy with the
        outcome.
